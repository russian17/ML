# Milestone 2: Descriptive Stats
## 1. Provide a summary of the different descriptive statistics you looked at and WHY.
To meet the business goals, I plan to explore and address each hypothesis posed in Milestone 1. Regardless of whether these hypotheses hold true, the process is valuable as it will provide insights derived from the data.
- Nations situated in higher latitudes may exhibit superior performance in winter sports, as evidenced by their medal tallies.

  Based on the two plots provided, which display the distribution of medals by country in the Winter Games and Summer Games respectively, there are observable trends that can support the thesis.

  In the Winter Games map, there is a concentration of darker colors at higher latitudes, particularly in North America and Europe. This indicates that these countries, which are in regions known for colder climates and thus more likely to have natural conditions suitable for winter sports, have won a significant number of medals.

  Comparatively, the Summer Games map shows a more globally dispersed medal tally, which suggests that the advantage held by higher latitude countries in Winter Games is less pronounced during Summer Games.

- The representation of female and male athletes in competitions has become more balanced throughout the years.
  
  The line chart provided demonstrates the trend of male and female athlete participation over a timeline from the early 1900s to the present. It shows two lines: one for the count of female athletes (female_count) and one for the count of male athletes (male_count).

  From the early 1900s up to around the 1980s, there's a significant gap between male and female participation, with male participation being consistently higher. However, starting around the 1980s, we observe a notable increase in female participation. The gap between the two genders narrows, indicating a trend towards more balanced representation in competitions.

  While male participation still appears to be higher overall, the difference has decreased markedly in recent years. The peaks and troughs in both lines seem to coincide, suggesting that factors affecting participation likely impact both genders similarly.

- More industrially developed nations tend to accumulate a greater number of medals.
  
  The data shown in the image supports the idea that more industrially developed nations often accumulate a larger number of medals. The list is topped by the USA, with a significant lead in medal count, followed by other countries that are generally recognized for their industrial development and investment in sports infrastructure and programs.

  Notably, the 'URS', which refers to the Soviet Union, occupies the second position. It's important to recognize that the Soviet Union was a major powerhouse in international sports during its existence, heavily state-sponsored, and well-resourced in terms of sports development. The prominence of the URS in the medal count is reflective of its historical investment in sports as a means of demonstrating its superpower status during the Cold War era.

  Other countries on the list, such as Germany (GER), Great Britain (GBR), France (FRA), Italy (ITA), and Canada (CAN), are also known for their strong sports programs and facilities, which correlate with their economic development. Australia (AUS) and Russia (RUS), appearing lower on the list, still show significant medal counts, indicating that their respective sports initiatives and historical context contribute to their success in Olympic competitions.

- Athletes around the age of 25 may have a higher likelihood of securing medals in competitive events.
  The bar chart provided illustrates the distribution of medals won by athletes in different age groups. The age group '23-27' has the highest number of total medals, followed by the '<=22' group, the '28-32' group, and lastly the '33+' group, which has significantly fewer medals.

  This data suggests that athletes in the '23-27' age range, which encapsulates the age of 25, tend to win the most medals. This could be due to athletes reaching their physical peak or having the optimal combination of experience and physical capability during this age range. The drop in medal count as age increases might indicate that fewer athletes compete at higher ages or that performance could decline.

## 2. Submit 2-3 key points you may have discovered about the data, e.g. new relationships? Aha's! Did you come up with additional ideas for other things to review?
#### Key Discoveries:

- Climatic Advantage: The natural winter environment of high-latitude countries provides a competitive edge in Winter Games, potentially leading to greater investment in relevant sports.
- Gender Dynamics: The diminishing gender gap in sports could reflect broader social changes, with more support and opportunities for female athletes over the years.
- Economic Influence: There seems to be a persistent link between a countryâ€™s economic status and its sports achievements, highlighting the possible effects of infrastructure and funding on athlete performance.

#### Additional Review Ideas:

- Investigating the impact of home advantage by analyzing medal counts when countries host the Olympics.
- Assessing the influence of specific policies or investments in sports by different countries over time and their correlation with changes in medal counts.
- Exploring the retirement age of athletes across sports to understand career longevity and its relationship with performance.

## 3. Did you prove or disprove any of your initial hypotheses? If so, which one and what do you plan to do next?

The initial hypotheses concerning the relationship between latitude and winter sports performance, as well as the trend towards gender balance in athletic participation, have been substantiated by the data. The hypothesis regarding the prime age for athletes securing medals has also found support. Moving forward, the plan is to delve deeper into these areas to understand the underlying factors driving these outcomes.

## 4. What additional questions are you seeking to answer?

- Post-Soviet Performance: How has the break-up of the Soviet Union influenced the Olympic success of its former states compared to consistent achievers like the USA?

- Diversity's Impact on Medals: How does the multicultural makeup of athletes, such as those of Jamaican descent representing the USA, affect Olympic success?

- Age and Medal Trends: What are the age-related trends in winning different types of Olympic medals, and how have these trends shifted over time?

- Sport Lifespan at the Olympics: What does the addition and removal of certain sports from the Olympics reveal about changing global sports interests?

- Economic Influence on Performance: How do economic factors and individual sponsorships impact Olympic success in countries with less government support?

- Training and Age: Are there identifiable trends in how training methods affect Olympic success across different age groups?
